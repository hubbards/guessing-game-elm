## Instructions

We will assume that this project exists locally and we are logged into a shell
where the root of the project is the working directory.

We will also assume that [Elm][elm] version 0.19.1 is installed.

### Unit Test

Assuming the [test runner][test] is installed, unit tests are run with the
`elm-test` command.

### View Web App

View the web app by completing the following steps
1. run the Elm reactor and
2. navigate to the web app in a web browser.

We can run the Elm reactor with the `elm reactor` command.

### Play Game

The guessing game is played between a user and the computer. The user chooses a
number from a list of numbers and the computer tries to guess the users number.

When the computer makes a guess, click on the "lower", "higher", or "correct"
buttons.

A new game can be started by clicking on the "new game" button.
